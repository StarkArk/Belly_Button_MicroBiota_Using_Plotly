## Belly Button Biodiversity

In 2011 the Public Science Lab at NC State began collecting samples of bacteria from human navels. By 2012 they had collected enough samples and published their results and data.

This project takes that data and puts it on display in an interactive web-based dashboard.

### Methods
	
The [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/basic-charts/) javascript libraries were used to make the interactive dashboard.

### Files:

- [Samples](https://github.com/StarkArk/belly_button_microbiota_with_plotly/blob/main/samples.json): A json file with the sample data 
- [Index](https://github.com/StarkArk/belly_button_microbiota_with_plotly/blob/main/index.html): html file for the website
- [App](https://github.com/StarkArk/belly_button_microbiota_with_plotly/blob/main/static/js/app.js): javascript that implements the dashboard
